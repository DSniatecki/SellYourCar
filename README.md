- update auction ( some fields are unchangeable )
- delete auction ( soft delete, remains in the database, but is not shown in the search results )
- upgrade auction to premium auction ( higher in the search results )
- retrieve auction ( contains all available fields to the user )
- retrieve all auctions ( contains only basic fields )
- retrieve page of auctions ( contains only basic fields )
- retrieve page of auctions by word ( Search for the auction page, which 
  contatins in the title/car brand/car model given the word )
